testNib_seq_N.fa: Reference sequence (10kbp region of human genome)

outN.fasta and outN.vcf: Simulated SV (generated using SURVIVOR)

outN.fasta_1/2.fasta: Simulated paired-end illumina reads of outN.fasta (using mason)

outN.cram are generated by mapping simulated illumina reads to Reference sequence (using BWA and samtools)
